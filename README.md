# Sisc-Lab

Note, any new functions should be added into "functions.hpp" file. There are already two functions in there, you can refer to it to see the format.

Hopefully, the functions are tested to work with the other related files before committing.
Whenever a new array or vector is encountered please use a null vector or array as input and if its not possible please write the final size of the outputs and the size of the input arguments for the function.

Thanks! and Happy Collaborating!
